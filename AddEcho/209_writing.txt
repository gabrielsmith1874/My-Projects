NAME
	addecho - add an echo effect to a mono WAV audio file

SYNOPSIS
	addecho [-d  delay] [-v volume_scale] sourvewav destwav

DESCRIPTION
	addecho takes in an existing WAV file and creates a new WAV file that is the original WAV file with echo added
	to it. The WAV files that the program operates on have a sampling rate of 22050 Hz. The echo effect is added 
	by blending the original sound with a delayed, volume-scaled version of itself. There are 2 parameters which 
	control the echo effect:

	delay: specifies how many samples to wait before mixing the echoing copy of the audio with the original copy of
	the audio. Since the WAV files operated on have a sampling rate of 22050, a delay of x will cause the echo to 
	start x / 22050 seconds after the sound starts. If a value is not provided, a default value of 8000 is used. 

	volume_scale: Determines the amount by which to scale down the volume of the echoing copy of the audio. If a 
	value is not provided, a default value of 4 is used.

	Unlike other methods that require loading the entire audio files into memory, addecho is optimized in the way
	that it keeps only the most recent delay samples of the volume-scaled original audio in an echo buffer. This
	optimization lets addecho efficiently handle potentially large audio files.

	The resulting file will contain the echo effect and have the same number of samples as the echoing copy.

RETURN VALUES
	addecho returns the following values:

	0 if the echo effect was successfully added to the resulting WAV audio file.

	1 if an error occured while executing the program.

EXAMPLES
	To add an echo effect with a delay of 6900 samples and a volume scale of 2 to LastChristmas.wav and save the
	result as LastChristmasEcho.wav:

	addecho -d 6900 -v 2 LastChristmas.wav LastChristmasEcho.wav

	To add an echo effect with delay of 4200 samples and a volume scale of 3 to ClubTropicana.wav and save the
	result as ctEcho.wav:

	addecho -d 4200 -v 3 ClubTropicana.wav ctEcho.wav

WARNINGS
	The program is designed to work with mono WAV audio files. Using stereo or other file formats may result in 
	unintended behaviour.	
	
	Large delay values or large volume scaling may produce unintended results or distortions in the resulting 
	audio file.

	The inputted values for volume and delay must be greater than 0.

BUGS
	In some cases, if the delay value is larger than the length of the inputted audio file, the echo effect may not
	be audible.
